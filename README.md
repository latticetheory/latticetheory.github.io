## About

The **Lattice Theory** [github organization](https://help.github.com/articles/about-organizations/) was initially created as a place on the web to
honor the long and productive careers of three mathematicians:

+ Ralph Freese

  [homepage](https://www.math.hawaii.edu/~ralph))

+ Bill Lampe

+ JB Nation  
  [J.B. Nation](https://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb)
  ([latticetheory.org page](https://www.math.hawaii.edu/~ralph),

## Biographies

Both Freese and Nation earned their PhD's under the advisment of [Robert Dilworth](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dilworth.html) at Caltech, with Ralph graduating in 1972 and JB in ????

Lampe earned his PhD at Penn State under the advisement of Frink and Gratzer.
