The **Lattice Theory** [github organization](https://help.github.com/articles/about-organizations/) was initially created during the ALH-2018 conference to honor of the long and productive careers of three mathematicians:

+ [Ralph Freese](https://www.math.hawaii.edu/~ralph))

+ [Bill Lampe](https://www.math.hawaii.edu/~bill)  

+ [JB Nation](https://www.math.hawaii.edu/~bill))


<!-- ## Biographies

Both Freese and Nation earned their PhD's under the advisment of [Robert Dilworth](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dilworth.html) at Caltech, with Ralph graduating in 1972 and JB in ????

Lampe earned his PhD at Penn State under the advisement of Frink and Gratzer. -->
